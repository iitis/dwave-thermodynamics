\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}


\section{Results}\label{sec2}


\section{Methods}\label{sec3}
The D-wave processor is an open quantum system that exchanges energy in the form of heat with the environment and work with the external time-dependent control fields. Accordingly, the D-wave processor is a thermal machine which was recently confirmed,  where it was shown that the D-Wave 2000Q under the reverse-annealing protocol, operates as a quantum heat engine.  \\
Motivated by the recent results for high fidelity control of the ground state of the Ising model by minimising the adiabatic action, we are interested in analyzing the thermodynamical efficiency of D-Wave quantum annealers, via different quantum annealing schedules: reverse, and pausing. 

The Hamiltonian governing the evolution of the D-Wave chip is:
\begin{equation}
    H(s_t)=(1-s_t)\sum_i \sigma_i^x + s_t \left( \sum_i h_i \sigma_i^z + \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} J_{i,j} \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z \right).
    \label{ham}
\end{equation}

We assume that initially the system+environment state is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \rho=\frac{\exp{(-\beta_1 H_S)}}{Z_S} \otimes \frac{\exp{(-\beta_2 H_E)}}{Z_E}.
\end{equation}

Accordingly, the quantum exchange fluctuation theorem gives:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{p(\Delta E_1,\Delta E_2)}{p(-\Delta E_1,-\Delta E_2)}=e^{\beta_1 \Delta E_1 + \beta_2 \Delta E_2},
    \label{eq3}
\end{equation}
Where $\Delta E_i, i=1,2$ are, respectively, the (stochastic) energy changes of the processor and its environment, occurring in the scheduled time $\tau$, and $p(\Delta E_1,\Delta E_2)$ is the joint probability of their occurrence in a single run of the annealing schedule.\\
By identifiying the entropy production $\Sigma =\beta_1 \Delta E_1 + \beta_2 \Delta E_2$. Eq.~\eqref{eq3} can be re-written as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{p(\Sigma,\Delta E_1)}{p(-\Sigma,-\Delta E_1)}=e^{\Sigma}. 
\end{equation}
Using the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, we can express lower bounds of the entropy production $\langle \Sigma \rangle$, the average work $\langle W\rangle$, and the average heat $\langle Q\rangle$ as a function of the energy change of the processor $\Delta E_1$:
\begin{align}
    \langle \Sigma \rangle &\geq  2g\left(\frac{\langle \Delta E_1 \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \Delta E_1^2 \rangle}}\right),\\
    -\langle Q \rangle &\geq \frac{2}{\beta_2}g\left(\frac{\langle \Delta E_1 \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \Delta E_1^2 \rangle}}\right) - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} \langle \Delta E_1 \rangle,\\
    \langle W \rangle &\geq \frac{2}{\beta_2}g\left(\frac{\langle \Delta E_1 \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \Delta E_1^2 \rangle}}\right) + \left( 1 - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} \right) \langle \Delta E_1 \rangle,
\end{align}
where $g(x)=x\tanh^{-1}{(x)}$.

The thermodynamic efficiency is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{\text{th}} \leq - \frac{ \langle W \rangle}{ \langle Q \rangle}.
\end{equation}



\section{Data availability}\label{sec7}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
